React - tic-tac-toe game

This has been created using React, HTML, CSS and lets an user play basic tic-tac-toe. It indicates when a player has won the game and stores the game's history as the game progresses. 
It also allows players to review a game's history, see previous versions of a game's board and sort the moves in ascending or descending order.

It utilizes the following concepts:
- Fragments (<> and </>) to wrap multiple JSX elements
- passing data through props
- useState hook to track the state of a function component
- React DevTools to check the props and the state of components
- lifting state into a parent component when refactoring components
- implementing immutability using array slice() method 
- assigning a key to a list
- use of array map() method to transform one array into another

Deployed using github pages.
